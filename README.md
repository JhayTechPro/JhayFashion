Hey mate!!
I designed a webpage for a fashion website called Jhay Fashion. I selected and integrated images, created product names, descriptions, and prices. Additionally, I ensured the website was responsive across mobile, laptop, and tablet devices for a user-friendly experience using HTML and CSS.
kindly check 'em out and drop and let me know if there's any suggestion you'd like me to add.
Thanks.    
yours sincerely,
JHAYTECHPRO
